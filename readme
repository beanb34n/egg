You are presented with a multistory building and some number of superstrong eggs. These eggs
can withstand drops from some height; you must figure out just what this height is. You are told that
there is some floor, f0, such that the eggs can survive the drop from f0 but will break when dropped
from floor f0 + 1. f0 may be the top of the buildingâ€”that is, the eggs may not break at all. (Note
that in each game all the eggs you are given have the same superstrength, i.e., if one breaks when
dropped from a certain height, they all will.)
You want to determine the value of f0 as efficiently as possible, that is, by making the fewest
number of droppings. Of course, you must guarantee that you find f0 before you run out of eggs, so
any strategy must take this into account.
